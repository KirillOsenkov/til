can leverage the cool HashCode type from .NETCore. It is mentioned in docs as available in \".NET Platform Extensions 3.1\", which isn't quite clear what it means. After a quick search here and there, I found out the Microsoft.Bcl.HashCode package, which seems to be one such \".NET platform extension\" (although the version # doesn't match either :/).\nWith that, I can now make a KeyValuePairComparerto check for dictionaries equality like:\n    public class KeyValuePairComparer : IEqualityComparer>\n    {\n        public static KeyValuePairComparer Default { get;} = new KeyValuePairComparer();\n\n        public bool Equals(KeyValuePair x, KeyValuePair y) => object.Equals(x.Key, y.Key) && object.Equals(x.Value, y.Value);\n\n        public int GetHashCode(KeyValuePair obj) => HashCode.Combine(obj.Key, obj.Value);\n    }\n\nTo be used as: \nIReadOnlyDictionary first = ...\nIReadOnlyDictionary second = ...\n\nreturn first.SequenceEquals(second, KeyValuePairComparer.Default);\n\n"},"dotnet/how-to-locate-dotnet.html":{"url":"dotnet/how-to-locate-dotnet.html","title":"How to locate dotnet","summary":"How to locate dotnet from the currently running .NET Core application","keywords":"","body":"How to locate dotnet\nI've seen a bunch of DotNetMuxer implementations, but they all look quite similar (if not exactly the same). \n\nASP.NET Core (same used by others, like Orleans)\n.NET runtime, .NET extensions\nAzure WebJobs SDK (same as Azure Functions SDK)\n.NET command-line-api\n\nSeems like there are two approaches: those that try to locate a FX_DEPS_FILE file and those that just use the current process' MainModule (which would be dotnet[.exe] itself for a .NET Core app. The latter looks simpler and the former seems unnecessary, until you take into account self-contained .NET Core apps or even trimmed self-contained, but even that version doesn't work in those cases :(\n"},"testing/conditional-unit-tests.html":{"url":"testing/conditional-unit-tests.html","title":"Conditional unit tests","summary":"How to run xunit tests conditionally depending on the environment that is running the tests","keywords":"","body":"Conditional unit tests\nTurns out that there aren't any conditional FactAttribute in xunit, but you can pretty much copy wholesale the extensions created by the ASP.NET Core team from their repo.\nIt allows you to do things like:\n[SkipOnCI]\n[ConditionalFact]\npublic async Task SomeTest()\n\nto avoid running a test entirely if you're on CI. the implementation didn't take into account CI builds running via GH actions/workflows, so I tweaked the OnCI() method like so to also consider the commonly used CI envvar too:\npublic static bool OnCI() => \n   (bool.TryParse(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"CI\"), out var ci) && ci) || \n   OnHelix() || OnAzdo();\n\nI didn't think it was necessary to create an OnGitHub method since the envvar is just CI and well, the method is already called OnCI :)\nAnother alternative is using the Xunit.SkippableFact nuget package.\n"},"testing/skip-tagged-scenarios-in-specflow-with-xunit.html":{"url":"testing/skip-tagged-scenarios-in-specflow-with-xunit.html","title":"Skip tagged scenarios in SpecFlow with Xunit","summary":"How to skip scenarios with a certain tag from executing","keywords":"","body":"Skip tagged scenarios in SpecFlow with Xunit\nFirst apply a tag of your choosing to flag scenarios that are still not ready for running:\nFeature: Skipping scenarios by tag\n\n@Draft\nScenario: This is not ready yet\n    Given Something not done yet\n    Then It should not fail the CI build (yet)\n\nNow in the [Binding] class for any of the steps in the scenario, create a constructor that receives the ScenarioContext as follows:\npublic Steps(ScenarioContext context)\n{\n   Skip.If(context.ScenarioInfo.Tags.Contains(\"Draft\"));\n}\n\nThat's it.
