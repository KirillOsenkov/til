A very convenient way (if not comprehensive, since it won't include with transitive dependencies) to do so is by annotating your PackageReference themselves, like:\n\n\nThe Pack metadata value can then be used to include the assets in the package with the following target:\n  \n  \n    \n       '%(NuGetPackageId)')\" />\n    \n    \n      @(NuGetPackageId -&gt; Distinct())\n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      @(PackageReferenceDependency -> '%(Pack)')\n    \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nQuite a few things to note in the above target that aren't too obvious:\n\nWe use the RuntimeCopyLocalItems item group which is resolved by ResolvePackageAssets and contains the stuff that is needed for the dependency to run (i.e. the actual binaries, not reference assemblies, if it includes them).\nWe use Inputs/Outputs on it so we can batch by %(RuntimeCopyLocalItems.NuGetPackageId): this makes processing simpler inside the target, since we'll be dealing with a single NuGetPackageId for each batch, regardless of how many RuntimeCopyLocalItemsthere are.\nWe next get that package ID as a property, and find the @(PackageReference) with that ID, to determine if it needs to be packed or not.\nNote we use property syntax next since we know there can be at most one such @(PackageReferenceDependency), in which case we'd get either an empty value or true for %(Pack).\nIf we have to pack, we include all the @(RuntimeCopyLocalItems) (in the current batch, MSBuild does this for us for free thanks to the Inputs/Outputs) and use as the package path the same as what the primary project output will use. These are added directly as _PackageFiles which is what the SDK-style project Pack uses.\nWe update the items metadata so they are also flagged as copy-local\nFinally, the ResolvedFileToPublish is useful when creating dotnet tools, since packing those is slightly different and includes a publish operation.\n\n"},"msbuild/how-to-build-project-when-content-files-change.html":{"url":"msbuild/how-to-build-project-when-content-files-change.html","title":"How to build project when content files change","keywords":"","body":"How to build project when content files change\nVisual Studio will typically just report the project is up-to-date and doesn't need to be built if you just changed a Content or None item.

Moving them also failed in the portal, so I looking at a non-enjoyable time copying/pasting files over.
